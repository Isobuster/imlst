// Opens a zip file and immediately targets the *.cue file 
// Next the *.wav files (referenced from the *.cue) are automatically found as well (IsoBuster >= 5.5)

// Advantages:
// - *.zip can still be associated with a typical zip program (or your Windows OS itself)
// - *.imlst on the other hand is associated with IsoBuster (and a double click on it opens the zip file in IsoBuster)
